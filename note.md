Strategy and tricks:

Linked List
1. Create a dummy head in the beginning of head to always keep a head. (Because sometimes need to manipulate original head multiple times, such as removing head)
Ex: 82,203

String
1. Using toCharArray method in Class String will be helpfull when rearrange or change multiple characters in a string and creating new string with the char array to get new modified string.
Ex: 242, 345

Array
1. Arrays.sort method is good for problems (not sort-based problems), which are needed to find something in order, such as using binary search.
Ex: 136,217,268,349
