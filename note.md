Strategy and tricks:

Linked List
1. Create a dummy head in the beginning of head to always keep a head. (Because sometimes need to manipulate original head multiple times, such as removing head)
Ex: 82,203

String
1. Using toCharArray method in Class String will be helpfull when rearrange or change multiple characters in a string and creating new string with the char array to get new modified string.
Ex: 242, 345
